# Site 14 Development Wiki

This is the `mdbook`-based developer documentation for Site 14.

The site is currently hosted at [https://Foundation-Site-14.github.io](https://Foundation-Site-14.github.io).

Benefits of the current docs site infrastructure include:
- First-class git support, open source and actually editable by everyone
- Decently familiar & comfortable for developers since `mdbook` use is very widespread
- No sign-on infrastructure or hosting necessary (besides GH pages), if forks would like to host their own
- Very low friction to adding new pages and editing/fixing old ones
- High level of customizability with styling and easy custom scripting
- Eventual localization support

The following `mdbook` features & plugins are available and in use:
- `MathJax` support 
- Sidebar ToC (integrated directly into `index.hbs` etc)
- `mdbook-mermaid`
- `mdbook-linkcheck`
- `mdbook-template`
- `mdbook-admonish`
- `mdbook-emojicodes`

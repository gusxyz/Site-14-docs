# Research

Research obtains points like before, however they can only get points from testing on SCPs and nothing else
There will be a limited number of testing areas on site, each equipped with a testing computer. Tests performed in designated testing chambers with valid computers will generate points. The higher object class an SCP is the more points it will give, and cross tests give even more
Testing on the same SCP multiple times in a short period of time will result in a temporary point penalty applied to that SCP, the length and severity determined by the amount of times it was tested on
Permanent debuffs will also be applied to categories rather than SCPs
Research can use the points to research weapons gear and other things like normal
However weapons and gear must be prototyped first before they can be crafted. Research will have the ability to craft a large amount of “Prototype Parts” to construct a prototype for a gear or weapon item, the amount of parts needed determined by the item. Once a prototype is constructed it will receive a random stat change depending on the parts used, the item can be tested, and if Research is happy with the results they can finalize the design, and unlock the ability to craft the item. However its stats cannot be changed past this point
Prototype parts can also be tested on and instead of giving points, they reveal their stat changes, the amount that is revealed depends on how many points the test would normally give

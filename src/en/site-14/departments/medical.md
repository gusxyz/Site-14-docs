They function very similar to how they do in the base game with a few exceptions
Research can use medical staff during tests
Chemistry can develop anomalous drugs to cure ailments better
Need to figure out anomalous effects through examinations and autopsies
MTF Delta-4 (Minutemen)
D4 would receive a small area somewhere on the site, within this area they have a small drop pod as well as a sighting computer
Accessing the sighting computer allows them to see a list of SCP sightings as well as very little details about the nature of the anomaly
After selecting an anomaly they can deploy to the location in their drop pod, they will be given a limited amount of time to locate and secure the SCP. In these “expeds” the only hostile that they would face would be the SCP and/or entities originating from it. Dying on an expedition would be rare but not impossible, and if it does happen it is a consequence that the site will have to deal with
After the SCP is secured they can either choose to return to Site 14 with it, or they can have it shipped off to another site via cargo which would result in a small budget increase for cargo

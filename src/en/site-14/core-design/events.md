# Events

### MTF Epsilon-11 (Nine Tailed Fox) :cat:
Function primarily as an Emergency Response Team for large scale containment breaches and GOI raids that the site is not winning. Will take a large amount of time to arrive at the site (15-25 minutes, this time is up to debate)

### System Failure
Failure of power systems, or loss of containment of a random anomaly or containment cell

### SCP 9711-S Appearance
SCP 9711-S has a containment chamber in LCZ, and is a euclid class anomaly. 9711-S Is a small human skull that will occasionally open a gateway above it leading to SCP 9711-S-1
When the gateway opens the site can decide if they want to ignore it or explore it
While inside the gateway it will appear as a topographical unstable cave that can result in people getting lost or dying. When the gateway is about to close it will make distinct sounds, and when it closes everyone inside dies. Exits will not be hard to find, but there will also be a chance to not find one and get killed
Only D class should enter SCP 9711-S-1. D Class sent it will have camera and audio monitors that will occasionally cut out when topography changes
Inside anomalous material can be found that when analyzed will yield medium amounts of points
Occasionally while video and audio feeds are cut SCP 9711-S-2 will appear resembling an old man that will give D class contraband they can sneak out and use to riot

### GOI Assault
A GOI raids the site, with few members and less resources than the designated “GOI assault” gamemode. 
Site Agenda
Rewards
Earn rewards for completing agenda objectives
Staff Transfers allow the site to receive more staff even if no one else can late join. This also allows dead players to get back into the game, site staff get a selection of staff they could potentially receive and must choose one (example, either 5 D class or 2 Security officers). This depends on the objective completed
Budget increases permanently increase cargos budget
Other SCPs can also come in
Large amount of objectives, desired completion time ~2.5-3 hours
If all objectives are complete, the shuttle is called, and the shift is over. In RP, another shift is going to be transferred onto the station, and everybody gets to go home safe.
